# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview

This project is a simple, browser-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Users can play against the computer. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern web development practices.

## Features & Design

*   **Game Logic:** The core game logic is implemented in JavaScript. The computer's choice is randomized.
*   **User Interface:** The UI consists of buttons for the user to make a choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the game's outcome.
*   **Styling:** The application is styled with modern CSS, featuring a clean and responsive layout. It uses a vibrant color palette, drop shadows for depth, and interactive "glow" effects on buttons.
*   **Web Components:** The game could be encapsulated as a Web Component for reusability, but for this initial version, it will be a single-page application.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Transform the initial "Hello, world!" page into a functional Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Modify `index.html`:**
        *   Update the page title.
        *   Create the HTML structure for the game, including a title, user choice buttons, and result display areas.
    2.  **Modify `style.css`:**
        *   Apply modern and "bold" styling to the game elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and button effects.
    3.  **Modify `main.js`:**
        *   Implement the game logic.
        *   Add event listeners to the user choice buttons.
        *   Create functions to determine the winner and update the UI with the results.
